# Knowledge Sharing Platform

## Description

- To create a user-friendly and intuitive knowledge sharing platform for students.
- To implement core features such as user authentication, CRUD operations for posts, and interaction functionalities.
- Our goal is to create an online platform that provides a place for students to showcase their learnings in the form of a blog post but also acts as a networking and information hub for students and scientists at NRSC.
- Students can use this platform to publish blog posts, articles, and research papers, showcasing their learnings and
achievements. This not only provides them with a sense of
accomplishment but also builds a portfolio of their academic and extracurricular work.
